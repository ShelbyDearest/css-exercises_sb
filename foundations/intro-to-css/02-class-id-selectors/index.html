//This index provides the solution I have, myself, provided for the 02-class-id-selectors assignment, as a part of TOP. 
Please be advised the "style.css" and this "index.html" are the two files within this assignment that contain my personal solutions 
as instructed. Thanks!

//I would also like to add that number 5, for whichever reason is not provided within the readme file as it pertains to the exact details I am to change/include within my solution.
